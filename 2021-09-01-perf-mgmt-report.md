## 1. Introduction

Some introductory text:

- History - why are we doing this perf mgmt work?
- What is this document - this is the overall policy
- Other documents - mention the appendices, suggest that a quick guide is the best place to start

## 1.1. Scope

- What is in scope for this piece of work
- What is not in scope

## 1.2. Goals

- What specifically are we trying to achieve here.
- Ideally these things should be measurable, and we should measure them so that we know if we have been successful.
- Make sure that we can clearly link each of these goals to the system design, in both directions.

### 1.2.1 Individual Goals

- Promote a working environment conducive to happiness and good mental health
- Help them to do their best work
- Provide optimum challenges
- Provide support as required
- Reward and praise success
- Clarify roles and responsibility
- Clarify expectations to prevent overwork

### 1.2.2 Team Goals

- Help teams make best use of the resource available to them
- Help teams to operate in a more agile way
- Delivery of more value and higher quality to the public
- Better working relations/environment

### 1.2.3 Organisational Goals

- Produce evidence to demonstrate that our developers are contributing adequately (i.e. protect them from outside interference and misguided attempts to judge them)
- Support the long-term availability of a suitably skilled team of developers (i.e. the team needs to be a "going concern" in business-speak)
- Nurture human capital and retain staff by ensuring the culture is not overbearing
- Better alignment of 20% time work to improving Software Quality Dashboard and ensuring compliance with Software Quality Framework

---

## 2. Barriers to Success

- What could prevent us from achieving our goals.
- How will we avoid falling into these traps.

### 2.2.1 Individual Barriers

- Individuals usually fear and despise any approach to performance management.
- Individuals may refuse to comply with an intrusive process.
- Individuals may believe there is no reward for success, so why bother.

### 2.2.1 Team Barriers

- Performance management is often disconnected from the flow of work, and therefore gets overlooked.
- Lack of psychological safety in teams may hide or prevent useful feedback.
- Teams are often focussed more on deadlines and delivery rather than in creating the conditions for growth and workforce success.

### 2.2.1 Organisational Barriers

- May fail to generate the required team capabilities.
- Tempting to get lost in process rather than focusing on culture and mindset.
- Line managers (from Sean downwards) may find it difficult to find time to properly run the system.

## 3. Communication Plan

### 3.1 What's in a name

Why we should avoid calling this "performance management":

- Words are powerful and can elicit strong emotional responses
- Negative connotations associated with "performance management"
- This piece of work isn't just about managing performance, but also supporting people to do their best
- We're trying to instil a new purpose, mindset, and culture
- Doing new things in new ways requires a new name

Note: I'm still using the bad name in this document for the time being.

- Once we have decided what we're calling this thing, then I will re-write this section to turn it into a description of what the new things is (e.g. by reference to the values below)

### 3.2 System Values

We have decided to take a value-based approach to designing the new system.

Diagram: Goals + Values --> System

Why a values-based system is desirable:

- Clearly communicates our intentions
- If and when edge cases crop up, there is no need to invent policy on-the-fly (which may seem unfair or biased) - we can refer back to the values to help us decide what to do.


What values will our new system/culture embody and promote:

- Shift away from "assessing performance" and new focus on "enhancing performance"
- Focus on the future and not on the past
- Human centred and motivating, not process-centred and punitive
- Improvement-oriented, not compliance-oriented or judgemental
- Bottom-up and empowering, not top-down and controlling
- Objective and fair, not subjective and biased
- Team-based and collaborative, not individualistic and competetive
- Intrinsic and seamless, not standalone and disconnected from work

### 3.3 Consider the audience

How will we communicate about the performance management:

- With each other
- With developers
- With other colleagues e.g. DMs/POs




### Recommendations

- Choose a new name which reflects that this is a way to support the continuous growth of our staff.
- Specific suggestions e.g. "Developer Empowerment Programme" or "Grow Perform Succeed (GPS) (stolen from Gap).
- ACTION: DTLT to decide a new name.
- ACTION: Promote these values to developers. (Helpful if we can back them up with and/or link to specific implemmentation details!)
- ACTION: Produce guidance tailored specifically for developers in order to sell the benefits to them
- ACTION: Produce guidance tailored specifically for DMs/POs in order to sell the benefits to them

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities within the system

What are the roles of people in operating our performance management system:

- Sean
- Principals
- Jacob in particular (e.g. coaching for Senior developers)
- Senior developers
- Other developers
- DMs/POs
- Anyone else

There are various activities to be distributed amongst the stakeholders:

- Compliance with the process/system itself
- Collecting information (e.g. to support evaluation of performance)
- Filtering/evaluating information (e.g. who deserves praise this week)
- Meetings and interactions (e.g. weekly 1-2-1s, regular discussions with DMs/POs)
- Promotion/Communication (e.g. about the system, but also public praise for individuals)
- Decisions that may need to be taken in response to certain triggers
- Various kinds of support or intervention
- Production of educational or supporting documentation

Note about preserving the line management relationships:

- Recognise that there may need to be a slight change in specific circumstances where an individual has somehow performed so poorly that disciplinary action seems likely.
- A person's line manager should ALWAYS be suportive of and an advocate for their subordinate.
- Therefore they may need to be excluded from certain activities (or included in others) to protect their relationship with the subordinate.
- (Yes, even if the line manager themselves is the one who has concerns about the performance.)

## 5. More Things to include in this Report

Need to plan out the structure of the document as a whole so that I can find appropriate places for these things to go

### 5.1. Roles & Responsibilities

**Summary**

The new responsibilities acquired at each pay band build upon the responsibilities of the band below.

A developer's "role" is therefore the sum of all the responsibilities at their own band and of the bands below.

However, as developers increase in seniority their general focus is expected to shift from individual work to a whole-team approach.

**Responsibility Matrix**

The responsibility matrix below shows pay bands across the top and areas of responsibility down the side. The new responsibilities acquired at each role are therefore set out in a columnar fashion.

|ROLE TITLE|Developer (bands 6 & 7)|Senior Developer (band 8a)|Principal Engineer (band 8b)|Development & Test Manager (band 8c)|
|---| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | -------------- |
| **FOCUS** | **SELF** | **SINGLE TEAM** | **MULTIPLE TEAMS** | **ALL TEAMS** |
|**CODE**| Feature Development | System Design and Technical Specialism | Engineering Quality Framework |                |
|**LEADERSHIP and AUTONOMY**| 20% Time | SDMT Operational Planning | Strategy Implementation and Lean Improvement Projects | Vision and Strategy |
|**GROWING THE TEAM**| Code Reviews | Mentoring and Pairing | Coaching | Coaching and Delegation |
|**PEOPLE**| Buddy to Apprentice | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 6/7 | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8a and Contractors | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8b and Contractors |
|**FINANCE**|  |  | Payments to Contractors | Overall budget |


**Time Allocation**

When deciding what to work on next, there is one simple rule:

> Prioritise those activities delivering the most benefit to others

This will usually mean a developer working on activities in their own column in favour of activities in preceeding columns.



### 5.2 Designed programme of coaching support

- First iteration from October to April will be targeted at Senior developers
- 6 x 1 hour sessions
- Current and specific issues for each developer will be tackled

There will also be some planned content and exercises covering:

- self-confidence
- self-knowledge
- critical thinking skills
- specific concepts related to agile/lean etc.
- the specific roles and responsibilities within delivery teams (DM/PO/dev/etc.)


ACTION:

- Jacob to plan specific content and suporting materials.
- (In progress as "This is the way" piece of work and will form part of coaching planning work rather than this report)


### 5.3 Expected Performance Targets

Deliberately starting off light and breezy so that it is almost impossible to fail.

Re-consider April 2022, possibly ratcheting up and/or including more things we wish to target.

Basic goals:

- Participate in and comply with the system we design
- Commit code which makes its way to production each sprint - Sikander has agreed to look into how we could measure this
- Move some Jira tickets (i.e. to "Done") each sprint - Snehal has agreed to look into how we could measure this
- Stretch goal: Evidence that feedback (from real users not 6 people in a lab!) about freshly-deployed code is being used to drive the activities in subsequent sprints
- Stretch goal: Evidence that retrospectives take place and that these lead to actionable and completed improvement activities
- 2 hours of training documented each week
- Complete 3 personal objectives during 20% time each quarter (to be focused on software quality dashboard outcomes)
- Comply with the new corporate system (e.g. how many objective and "check-ins" to record there etc.) 

Questions to resolve:

- How should targets differ for different bands?
- To what extent is it about behaviour, and how should that be measured

Participation and compliance

- This is a special type of meta-monitoring
- Principals will need to be held to account for ensuring Senior Devs do what is required, and so on

How this all fits with the existing line management arrangements:

- Staff will be asked to document their accomplishments through the week
- Staff will discuss and reflect on these accomplishments with their line managers each week
- Benefit to them: This record of continuing professional development will assist them in progressing their career. (e.g. by making it easier to prepare for promotion)
- Benefit to them: ... Need more ways to sell this as a useful thing to the individual and the line manager.



### 5.4 Triggers and Interventions

Set out in plain language what will be the triggers for intervention.

Also set out what interventions we will be willing to take in extreme circumstances.

Example:

- We may wish to consider offering staff the ability to voluntarily drop down a band if they consistently fail to meet performance targets.
- If so, we'd need to do the work now to identify how we could make that work with HR.
- But we also need a bullet-proof way to fairly (i.e. without bias) establish that this was now the correct outcome, and that we have tried everything else.
- We'd also need to clearly set out how this is a "kind" intervention for the individual, designed to more appropriately challenge them with work they would be able to succeed at. (Optimum challenge)

Positive triggers:

- Note that crucially we need to set out some triggers for positive actions.
- For example, if a developer completes an objective then Sean should mention this in the next update he delivers.
- Plenty of other potential positive triggers: shipping code N sprints in a row, obtaining a new qualification, etc.


### 5.5 Contractors

- How should we manage the performance of contractors?
- Should we even try?
- Is it even our responsibility?
- Should DMs not Principal Engineers line manage the contractors?
- What could be the impact on developers if they are part of this new system but contractors are not?



### 5.6 Reporting Cycle

How often and for whom should we be producing reports or information.


### 5.7 Consultation

I would like to give developers the opportunity to comment on this report (and its supporting info) for a whole month after it is published on 1st September 2021.

Am considering whether opening it up to pull requests in GitHub may be a useful way to do this.

Aim to begin implementation in October. At the very least each Senior Dev should have had their first coaching session prior to things beginning.


### 5.8 Retrospective and Review

How often and when specifically do we plan to review the perf mgmt system.

If our "trial run" goes from October to end of March then we'd like iteration 2 to be ready to begin in April 2022.


### 5.9 Calendar/Timeline

This is an evolution of the previous "practice" system Jacob already put in place. We can reuse some of the diagrams used to explain that system (in particular the goal-setting and 1-2-1 reviews) because they remain identical.

Need to produce a calendar showing key activities

Monthly-ish granularity i.e. to the level of when devs should be updating the corporate system with news about completed objectives.

The Principals and Sean may also wish for a separate timeline regarding where I plan to be in the creation of this report between now and 1st September.

### Checklists

Why checklists work (e.g. Checklist Manifesto, and also reference medical usage)

We will provide checklists for:

- What Sean needs to do
- What Principals need to do
- What Senior Devs need to do
- What other devs need to do

(These need to be situational)
