## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 What is The Way We Work?

This document sets out our vision for the environment and culture within which we wish NHSUK software developers to operate. It also explains how we intend to bring about and maintain that environment and culture.

As such, this document is intended to provide an overall policy position so that the leadership team (DTLT) can act independently in a fair and consistent way while bringing about the policy objectives.

While we'd encourage all developers and related professionals to read this document, we'd also recommend referring to the relevant Quick Guide in the appendices to see what this policy means for you specifically. 

## 1.2 Why have we created The Way We Work?

Recent surveys of NHSUK developers have told us that in order to do their best work they need a clearer explanation of their roles and more support from DTLT. This document is our attempt to meet those needs.

DTLT have also been receiving strong messages from both the Director of Product Delivery, its Head of Engineering, and our own Head of Delivery about the urgent need to re-focus our activities to secure improvements in certain key areas. This document explains the systems which we believe will bring about those improvements. 

## 1.3. Scope of The Way We Work

- What is in scope:  
    - Developer Roles & Responsibilities
    - Expected behaviours
    - Explanation of how support will be provided

- What is not in scope:  
    - TODO




## 2. Goals of $THIS

- What specifically are we trying to achieve here.

### 2.1 Individual Goals

- Promote a working environment conducive to happiness and good mental health
- Help them to do their best work
- Provide optimum challenges
- Provide support as required
- Reward and praise success
- Clarify roles and responsibility
- Clarify expectations to prevent overwork

### 2.2 Team Goals

- Help teams make best use of the resource available to them
- Help teams to operate in a more agile way
- Delivery of more value and higher quality to the public
- Better working relations/environment

### 2.3 Organisational Goals

- Produce evidence to demonstrate that our developers are contributing adequately (i.e. protect them from outside interference and misguided attempts to judge them)
- Support the long-term availability of a suitably skilled team of developers (i.e. the team needs to be a "going concern" in business-speak)
- Nurture human capital and retain staff by ensuring the culture is not overbearing
- Better alignment of 20% time work to improving Software Quality Dashboard and ensuring compliance with Software Quality Framework

---

## 3. Barriers to Success

- What could prevent us from achieving our goals.
- How will we avoid falling into these traps.

### 3.1 Individual Barriers

- Individuals usually fear and despise any approach to performance management.
- Individuals may refuse to comply with an intrusive process.
- Individuals may believe there is no reward for success, so why bother.

### 3.2 Team Barriers

- Performance management is often disconnected from the flow of work, and therefore gets overlooked.
- Lack of psychological safety in teams may hide or prevent useful feedback.
- Teams are often focussed more on deadlines and delivery rather than in creating the conditions for growth and workforce success.

### 3.3 Organisational Barriers

- May fail to generate the required team capabilities.
- Tempting to get lost in process rather than focusing on culture and mindset.
- Line managers (from Sean downwards) may find it difficult to find time to properly run the system.

---

## 4. How we will measure our success

TODO

It's important to identify ways to see whether we're on track i.e.

- are we meeting our goals
- are we overcoming the barriers

Note that this isn't about measuring the performance of individuals. It's about measuring how well DTLT are doing at bringing about the desired environment and culture.

## 5. How we designed The Way We Work

The Way We Work is an evolution of the quarterly objective-setting and review cycle recently put in place, with the addition of various activities and structures to provide the clarity and support requested by developers and necessary to meet the targets set by senior Product Delivery leadership.

While it would have been standard practise to put in place a "performance management" system, we have instead opted to take a different approach. We believe that developers do their best work when they have the support they need and when they in turn use some of their time to help others.

We understand that it is difficult to describe what it is that makes up a working environment and culture. So we agreed to begin by setting out a set of guiding values to help us design and communicate The Way We Work:

TODO: Maybe rewrite some of these slightly, and also add a bit more detail for each

- Shift away from "assessing performance" and new focus on "enhancing performance"
- Focus on the future and not on the past
- Human centred and motivating, not process-centred and punitive
- Improvement-oriented, not compliance-oriented or judgemental
- Bottom-up and empowering, not top-down and controlling
- Objective and fair, not subjective and biased
- Team-based and collaborative, not individualistic and competetive
- Intrinsic and seamless, not standalone and disconnected from work

---

## 6. The Way We Work

### 6.1. Roles & Responsibilities

**Summary**

The new responsibilities acquired at each pay band build upon the responsibilities of the band below.

A developer's "role" is therefore the sum of all the responsibilities at their own band and of the bands below.

However, as developers increase in seniority their general focus is expected to shift from individual work to a whole-team approach.

**Responsibility Matrix**

The responsibility matrix below shows pay bands across the top and areas of responsibility down the side. The new responsibilities acquired at each role are therefore set out in a columnar fashion.

|ROLE TITLE|Developer (bands 6 & 7)|Senior Developer (band 8a)|Principal Engineer (band 8b)|Development & Test Manager (band 8c)|
|---| :--------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | -------------- |
| **FOCUS** | **SELF** | **SINGLE TEAM** | **MULTIPLE TEAMS** | **ALL TEAMS** |
|**CODE**| Feature Development | System Design and Technical Specialism | Engineering Quality Framework |                |
|**LEADERSHIP and AUTONOMY**| 20% Time | SDMT Operational Planning | Strategy Implementation and Lean Improvement Projects | Vision and Strategy |
|**GROWING THE TEAM**| Code Reviews | Mentoring and Pairing | Coaching | Coaching and Delegation |
|**PEOPLE**| Buddy to Apprentice | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 6/7 | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8a and Contractors | Line Management and Recruitment of Band 8b and Contractors |
|**FINANCE**|  |  | Payments to Contractors | Overall budget |


**Time Allocation**

When deciding what to work on next, there is one simple rule:

> Prioritise those activities delivering the most benefit to others

This will usually mean a developer working on activities in their own column in favour of activities in preceeding columns.


### 6.2 Expected behaviours

Deliberately starting off light and breezy so that it is almost impossible to fail.

Re-consider April 2022, possibly ratcheting up and/or including more things we wish to target.

Basic goals:

- Participate in and comply with the system we design
- Commit code which makes its way to production each sprint - Sikander has agreed to look into how we could measure this
- Move some Jira tickets (i.e. to "Done") each sprint - Snehal has agreed to look into how we could measure this
- Stretch goal: Evidence that feedback (from real users not 6 people in a lab!) about freshly-deployed code is being used to drive the activities in subsequent sprints
- Stretch goal: Evidence that retrospectives take place and that these lead to actionable and completed improvement activities
- 2 hours of training documented each week
- Complete 3 personal objectives during 20% time each quarter (to be focused on software quality dashboard outcomes)
- Comply with the new corporate system (e.g. how many objective and "check-ins" to record there etc.) 

Questions to resolve:

- How should targets differ for different bands?
- To what extent is it about behaviour, and how should that be measured

Participation and compliance

- This is a special type of meta-monitoring
- Principals will need to be held to account for ensuring Senior Devs do what is required, and so on

How this all fits with the existing line management arrangements:

- Staff will be asked to document their accomplishments through the week
- Staff will discuss and reflect on these accomplishments with their line managers each week
- Benefit to them: This record of continuing professional development will assist them in progressing their career. (e.g. by making it easier to prepare for promotion)
- Benefit to them: ... Need more ways to sell this as a useful thing to the individual and the line manager.


### 6.3 How we will support each other

TODO

What support-related roles and activities are expected of:

- Sean
- Principals
- Jacob in particular (e.g. coaching for Senior developers)
- Senior developers
- Other developers
- DMs/POs
- Anyone else

There are various activities to be distributed amongst the stakeholders:

- Compliance with the process/system itself
- Collecting information (e.g. to support evaluation of performance)
- Filtering/evaluating information (e.g. who deserves praise this week)
- Meetings and interactions (e.g. weekly 1-2-1s, regular discussions with DMs/POs)
- Promotion/Communication (e.g. about the system, but also public praise for individuals)
- Decisions that may need to be taken in response to certain triggers
- Various kinds of support or intervention
- Production of educational or supporting documentation

**Checklists**

Why checklists work (e.g. Checklist Manifesto, and also reference medical usage)

We will provide checklists for:

- What Sean needs to do
- What Principals need to do
- What Senior Devs need to do
- What other devs need to do

(These need to be situational)

**Coaching support**

- First iteration from October to April will be targeted at Senior developers
- 6 x 1 hour sessions
- Current and specific issues for each developer will be tackled

There will also be some planned content and exercises covering:

- self-confidence
- self-knowledge
- critical thinking skills
- specific concepts related to agile/lean etc.
- the specific roles and responsibilities within delivery teams (DM/PO/dev/etc.)

**Reporting**

TODO

What information will we record and pass up the chain. How will that information be used - i.e. why it is important that we are doing this.


**Triggers and Interventions**

TODO

Set out in plain language what will be the triggers for intervention.

Also set out what interventions we will be willing to take, including in extreme circumstances.

Example of "routine" intervention:

- E.g. developer fails to complete any of their objectives in a given quarter
- Discussion to take place with line manager and next manager up to agree what extra support can be provided.
- Line manager maybe also needs extra support? (Because this shouldn't have happened...)

Example of extreme intervention:

- We may wish to consider offering staff the ability to voluntarily drop down a band if they consistently fail to meet performance targets.
- If so, we'd need to do the work now to identify how we could make that work with HR.
- But we also need a bullet-proof way to fairly (i.e. without bias) establish that this was now the correct outcome, and that we have tried everything else.
- We'd also need to clearly set out how this is a "kind" intervention for the individual, designed to more appropriately challenge them with work they would be able to succeed at. (Optimum challenge)

Positive triggers:

- Note that crucially we need to set out some triggers for positive actions.
- For example, if a developer completes an objective then Sean should mention this in the next update he delivers.
- Plenty of other potential positive triggers: shipping code N sprints in a row, obtaining a new qualification, etc.


### 6.4 Quarterly objective setting cycle

TODO

This is going to be very similar to the system Jacob already put in place. We can reuse some of the diagrams used to explain that system (in particular the goal-setting and 1-2-1 reviews) because they remain identical.

Need to produce a calendar showing key activities

Monthly-ish granularity i.e. to the level of when devs should be updating the corporate system with news about completed objectives.

# UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS

This section is for recording 




## Contractors

- How should we manage the performance of contractors?
- Should we even try?
- Is it even our responsibility?
- Should DMs not Principal Engineers line manage the contractors?
- What could be the impact on developers if they are part of this new system but contractors are not?
